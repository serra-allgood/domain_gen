domain_gen
==========

An exercise in writing a simple concurrent Rust cli tool.
`domain_gen` takes in a list of words and a list of top-level domains,
and generates possible domains with the TLD acting as the end of the word.

Concurrent code is based on studying [ranagrams](https://github.com/dfhoughton/ranagrams),
and as such, this project is similarly licensed under the GPLv2.
